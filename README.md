Etch-a-Sketch Grid ðŸŽ¨

This is a simple Etch-a-Sketch / Pixel Sketch Pad project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It generates a grid of squares where each square changes color when you hover over it, creating a pixelated drawing effect.

âœ¨ Features

Generates a grid of squares (16x16 by default).

Hover over a square to fill it with a random RGB color.

A Reset button lets you enter the number of squares per side (up to 100), creating a new grid in the same 960px space.

Each grid resize clears the old one and redraws a fresh sketch pad.
